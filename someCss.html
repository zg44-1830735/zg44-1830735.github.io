          I'm Gibbs Geng (Zixuan), a senior studying Computer Science. My major interest lays in Database, nd I have a broad interest in Algorithm Design, Software Engineering and Machine Learning. 
          I am currently an undergraduate research assistant in UW database group since March 2020 and in the summer I was working as an REU intern with Prof. Dan Suciu on the explanation project in which we give explanations for bad labeled entities given black-box classifier.
          I am also a teaching assistant for introduction to databases since January 2020. And an ICPC region contestant last year!

        I'm current a sophomore at <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">UW</a>.
        I discovered my interest in  <span class="highlight">Computer Science</span>, a major said to be impossible to get in for incoming students, after I came here. I felt pretty
        lucky to be one of the last-year-students before their start of "DTM." Yep, below are a few of skills I currently have and pages about what
        I have done each quarter after I came here.

          Here is a list of the different kinds of <span class="highlight">tools and programming languages</span> I have
          encountered before(mainly related to the area of Computer Science):
        </p1>
        <p2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight">Java</span>: I'm kind of proficent at that since it's the first programming language
              I have been encountered with and I spend most of me time in it(took a lot of courses too!).
              Not only have I took the two basic programming courses here,CSE142 and CSE143, I was also
              an auditor both in CSE373 and CSE311.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight">Python</span>: I think that I'm doing well in python. Although I'm not oficially regislated any
              course in this area, I actually went to most of the lectures and done homeworks in CSE163,
              kind of the equivalent course as CSE143 in Java. I wrote several programs to solve different
              kinds of problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight">SQLite/XQuery (saxon he)/SQL Server on Windows Azure (Microsoft's Web Service)/Amazon ec2</span>:
              I'm famaliar with these dababase-oriented tool through my learning in CSE414.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight">yperText Markup Language (HTML)/Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)/avaScript (JS)/
              Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax)/PHP web services</span>: I'm kind of famaliar as I learn
              CSE154 online. This is partially a demonstration of my skills in this area.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight2">C++</span>: I only have some basic ideas about this language, since I didn't formally learn this
              language.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight2">R</span>: I have some experience with this language when studying STAT311.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="highlight2">Matlab</span>: I learned this tool in my AMATH301 class.
