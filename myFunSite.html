								<h3>Research</h3>
								<p> 
									I am currently an undergraduate research assistant in UW database group since March 2020 and in the summer I was working as an REU intern with Prof. Dan Suciu on the explanation project in which we give explanations for bad labeled entities given black-box classifier.
								</p>
								<p>Let me give you an example. Suppose some one wants to get loan from a bank, and he was reject by an automated classifier. He wants to know why. Our research is aim solve this problem to give reasons why he was reject and how he should to to witch the situation from bad to good.

									In the summer, I developed a genetic counterfactual model, which is generic to most machine learning models and reduced the latency to about 0.3s per entity to return the approximately most achievable actions for bad labeled entities.</p>
