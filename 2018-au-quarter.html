        This is the brief review of the classes, activities, and other staffs Gibbs Geng has done
        in the 2018 Autumn quarter. In this quarter, I'm particularly focus on getting used to my

        my social circle, and exploring my potential majors: Computer Science and Informatics!

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
